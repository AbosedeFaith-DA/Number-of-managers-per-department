# Project Insights
This chart effectively visualizes the gender composition of managers over time across various departments. The stacked area sections represent the count of active managers, with separate colors for male (M) and female (F) managers, making it easy to observe shifts in gender representation each year. Notably, there is a progressive increase in female representation, especially from the mid-1990s onward, indicating potential shifts in organizational policies or broader societal trends favoring gender diversity.

# Final Conclusion
The visualization highlights a gradual rise in female managers over time, suggesting enhanced gender diversity efforts within the organization or changes in recruitment and promotion practices. This information can support strategic planning and help guide future diversity and inclusion initiatives, ensuring balanced representation across leadership roles.
